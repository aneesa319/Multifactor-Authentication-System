# Multifactor-Authentication-System
   Developed a secure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system using Node.js, Express, and Google Authenticator. Users log in with username, password, and CAPTCHA. If MFA is not enabled, they scan a QR code to set it up. OTPs are verified using Speakeasy. The app uses EJS templates, Bootstrap 5 for UI, and express-session for session handling.
